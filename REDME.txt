we have a lot of products and they are common in a lot of features and methods then, create a parent class
Product and all the product will inherited from it and it can use all methods and properties
Class Tshirt, Shoes , jacket and Pants inherit from Products
some handle operations like how i can make a discount by another sell product or
just discount this product without any conditions so, pass 2 arguments to
setDiscount function (discount value , array of Products and number of items ) and inside the function will check
if the array null then  will put the discount directly if not will iterate into the array and check
if the number of customer buy from all products in this array and the number of products to make the discount
if the customer buy greater than or equal discount product items then will apply the discount.
how the price calculated first calculate the the result of product price multiply to number of product items.
then calculate the taxes of each product then calculate discount on the actual price if exist.
in currency section will use API currency conversion if user select another currency from USD will run the
ChangeCurrency function in this function use the price in USD then convert it to the desire currency
the api will get the actual price and update the product price
